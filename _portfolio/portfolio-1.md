**Objective**
Voice interaction or commands “Hey Google”, or “Hey Siri” rely on keyword spotting to start interaction on local device. It helps people experience “Hands-free” searching and task completion

**What & Why - Challenges in above technology**
- Triggers on negative wake words, unrelated speech, background noise, or silence
- High no. of instance, when device does not trigger on positive wake words
- Need for quick response & acknowledgment
- Ability to customise wake word
- Wake model to be lightweight & energy efficient

**Approach**
To design, build and deploy a lightweight Keyword spotting ML model (CNN, SVM) and exposed as a mobile-application that can process a “custom wake word”. Voice response with results by respecting local device resource constraints (low compute) and adhering to ethical challenges (Privacy respecting and non-eavesdropping)
